//  what is an algorithm?
// an algorithm is a series of contained steps, which you follow in order to achieve some goal, or to produce some output

// what is Big O notation
//  is a notation that a alow us clasify how scalable and algorithim   or a function is and stimate the worst case the runtime of an algorithem or how long it takes to an algorithem to complete base on the input size
//  so in another words this will let us know how slow an alogithem will grow if its input size groth

//Why is important to know Big O notation? Knowing Big O helps and facilitates developers being aware of the efficiency of an algorithm so they can create applications with good performance.

//Example

function log(array) {
  console.log(array[0]);
  console.log(array[1]);
}
log([1, 2, 3, 4]);
log([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]);
